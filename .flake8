# Flake8 is a powerful tool that checks our codeâ€™s compliance to PEP8. In order for black to work nicely with flake8
# (or prevent it from spewing out various errors and warnings), we need to list down some error codes to ignore.

# E203 - Colons should not have any space before them.
# E266 - Too many leading '#' for block comment
# E501 - Line too long (82 &gt; 79 characters)
# W503 - Line break occurred before a binary operator
# F403 - 'from module import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
# F401 - Module imported but unused (F401)
# E712 - Comparison to true should be 'if cond is true:' or 'if cond:'. Reason: tinydb queries
